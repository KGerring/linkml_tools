# Examples

This folder contains examples that use KGX to perform 
certain operations.

This folder also contains sample YAML files that can 
be used as input to KGX to drive certain operations.

For additional design patterns of KGX to consider, see also the [unit tests folder](../tests).

Note: the currently supported release of Neo4j is 4.3 (or better).
