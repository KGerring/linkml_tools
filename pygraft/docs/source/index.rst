.. automodule:: pygraft

**PyGraft** is an open-source Python library for generating synthetic yet realistic schemas and/or knowledge graphs based on user-specified parameters. The generated resources are domain-agnostic, i.e. they are not tied to a specific application field.

Being able to synthesize schemas and knowledge graph is an important milestone for conducting research in domains where data is sensitive or not readily available. PyGraft allows researchers and practitioners to generate schemas and KGs on the fly, provided minimal knowledge about the desired specifications. 

PyGraft has the following features:
- possibility to generate a schema, a KG, or both
- highly-tunable process based on a broad array of user-specified parameters
- schemas and KGs are built with an extended set of RDFS and OWL constructs
- logical consistency is ensured by the use of a DL reasoner (HermiT)
