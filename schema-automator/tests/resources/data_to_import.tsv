NGD is a measure of semantic similarity between two concepts derived from counts of the number of times they appear in a corpus of text. Concepts with the same or similar meaning will have an NGD score close to 0, while completely dissimilar concepts (those that never appear together) will have an infinite NGD score.

pointwise mutual information	Pointwise mutual information is an information theoretic measure of association between two concepts based on the probabilities of observing the concepts in isolation and together. Mathematically, pmi(x,y) = log(p(x,y)/(p(x)p(y))). For details see: Bouma, G. (2009). Normalized (pointwise) mutual information in collocation extraction. Proceedings of GSCL, 30, 31-40. https://svn.spraakdata.gu.se/repos/gerlof/pub/www/Docs/npmi-pfd.pdf	
normalized pointwise mutual information	Normalized Pointwise Mutual Information (NPMI) is PMI normalized to the range [1, -1]. When two concepts only occur together, NPMI = 1. When two concepts are observed to occur separately but never together, NPMI = -1. For details see: Bouma, G. (2009). Normalized (pointwise) mutual information in collocation extraction. Proceedings of GSCL, 30, 31-40. https://svn.spraakdata.gu.se/repos/gerlof/pub/www/Docs/npmi-pfd.pdf	
normalized pointwise mutual information max	Normalized Pointwise Mutual Information Max is a variant of NPMI proposed by Bouma 2009 whereby the PMI is normalized by -ln(max(p(x),p(y))). Using this normalization factor will result in an asymmetric measure whereby NPMImax=1 when one concept is occurs only in the context of another, but not necessarily the other way around. For details see: Bouma, G. (2009). Normalized (pointwise) mutual information in collocation extraction. Proceedings of GSCL, 30, 31-40. https://svn.spraakdata.gu.se/repos/gerlof/pub/www/Docs/npmi-pfd.pdf
